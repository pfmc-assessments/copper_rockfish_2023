The recreational fishery in the early part of the 20th century was focused on nearshore waters near ports, with expanded activity further from port and into deeper depths over time [@miller_spatially_2014]. Prior to the groundfish fishery being declared a federal disaster in 2000, and the subsequent rebuilding period, there were no time or area closures for groundfish. Access to deeper depths during this period spread effort over a larger area and filled bag limits with a greater diversity of species from both the shelf and nearshore. This resulted in lower catch of nearshore rockfish relative to the period after 2000 when 20 to 60 fm depth restrictions ranging from 20 fm in the Northern Management Area to 60 fm in the Southern Management Area were put in place in various management area delineations along the state (see Appendix Section \ref{ca-man}). This shifting effort onto the nearshore, concomitantly increased catch rates for nearshore rockfish including `r spp` in the remaining open depths, though season lengths were greatly curtailed.   

Following  all previously overfished groundfish species, other than yelloweye rockfish, being declared rebuilt by 2019, deeper depth restrictions were offered in the Southern Management area allowing resumed access to shelf rockfish in less than 75 fm and are currently 100 fm as of 2021. The increased access to deeper depths south of Point Conception with the rebuilding of cowcod is expected to reduce the effort in nearshore waters where `r spp` is most prevalent.  To the north of Point Conception where yelloweye rockfish are prevalent, depth constraints persist and effort remains focused on the nearshore in 30 to 50 fm depending on the management area.  As yelloweye rockfish continues to rebuild, incremental increases in access to deeper depths are expected, which will likely further reduce the effort in nearshore waters where `r spp` is most prevalent.

Prior to development of the live fish market in the 1980s, there was very little commercial catch of `r spp`, with dead `r spp` fetching a low ex-vessel price per pound. `r Spp` were targeted along with other rockfish to some degree in the nearshore or caught as incidental catch by vessels targeting other more valuable stocks such as lingcod.  Most fish were caught using hook and line gear, though some were caught using traps, gill nets and, rarely, trawl gear. Trawling was prohibited within three miles of shore in 1953 and gill netting within three miles of shore was prohibited in 1994, preventing access to a high proportion of the species habitat with these gear types. `r Spp` were caught along with other rockfish to some degree in the nearshore or caught as bycatch by vessels targeting other more valuable stocks such as lingcod.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s a market for fish landed live arose out of Los Angeles and the Bay area, driven by demand from Asian restaurants and markets. The growth of the live fish market was driven by consumers willing to pay a higher price for live fish, ideally plate-sized (12 - 14 inches or 30.5 - 35.6 cm). Live fish landed for the restaurant market are lumped into two categories, small (1 - 3 lbs.) or large (3 - 6 lbs.), with small, plate-sized, fish fetching higher prices at market ranging between $5 -7 per fish (Bill James, personal communication). `r Spp` is one of the many rockfish species that is included in the commercial live fish fishery. The proportion of `r spp` being landed live vs. dead since 2000 by California commercial fleets ranges between 50 to greater than 70 percent in the southern and northern areas, respectively. 
 
With the development and expansion of the nearshore live fish fishery during the 1980s and 1990s, new entrants in this open access fishery were drawn by premium ex-vessel price per pound for live fish, resulting in over-capitalization of the fishery. Since 2002, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) has managed 19 nearshore species in accordance with Nearshore Fisheries Management Plan [@wilson-vandenberg_implementing_2014]. In 2003, the CDFW implemented a Nearshore Restricted Access Permit system, including the requirement of a Deeper Nearshore Fishery Species Permit to retain `r spp`, with the overall goal of reducing the number of participants to a more sustainable level, with permit issuance based on historical landings history by the retrospective qualifying date.  The result was a reduction in permits issued from 1,127 in 1999 to 505 in 2003, greatly reducing catch levels. In addition, reduced trip limits, season closures in March and April and depth restrictions were implemented to address bycatch of overfished species and associated constraints from their low catch limits.
