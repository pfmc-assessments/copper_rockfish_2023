`r Spp` is managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) as a part of the Nearshore Rockfish North and Nearshore Rockfish South complexes, split at 40$^\circ$ 10' N. lat. off the West Coast. Each complex, comprised of nearshore rockfish species, is managed based on a complex level overfishing limit (OFL) and annual catch limit (ACL) that are determined by summing the species-specific OFLs and ACLs (ACLs set equal to the Acceptable Biological Catches) contributions for all stocks managed in the complex (North or South).  It is important to note tath aggregated removals across species within the Nearshore Rockfish North and South complexes are managed and tracked against the complex total OFL and ACL, rather than on a species by species basis.
